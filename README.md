# METRICSTICS APPLICATION

## Introduction

The METRICSTICS project addresses the fundamental need for effective descriptive statistics, offering a versatile toolkit for quantitatively summarizing data. Descriptive statistics play a pivotal role in understanding the characteristics of a dataset, providing insights into measures of central tendency, frequency, and variability. In the realm of METRICSTICS, our goal is to develop a robust system that can seamlessly process both real-world and artificially generated data, providing essential statistical metrics.

## Key Concepts

- **Minimum (m):** The smallest value in the dataset.
- **Maximum (M):** The largest value in the dataset.
- **Mode (o):** The most frequently occurring value.
- **Median (d):** The middle value (or mean of middle values) in the dataset.
- **Arithmetic Mean (μ):** The average value of the dataset.
- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):** The average absolute difference between each data point and the mean.
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a dataset.

## Project Objectives

The METRICSTICS project aims to create an interconnected set of artifacts designed to solve the challenges of calculating descriptive statistics. This includes accommodating varying data types, ensuring accuracy in statistical calculations, and providing a user-friendly interface for efficient data analysis.

## Getting Started

To utilize METRICSTICS Application, follow these steps:

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Project

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone the Project:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/desired/directory
    ```
3. Clone the Project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/23Fall-SOEN6611-TeamM/SOEN-6611.git
    ```

### Step 2: Open and Set Up in Visual Studio Code

4. Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code.
5. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code using `Ctrl + ``.
6. Navigate to the "D2/METRICSTICS" folder:
    ```bash
    cd D2/METRICSTICS
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Application
1. Rnn below command to inintalldependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```bash

### Step 4: Run the Application

7. To run the application, type the command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
   or click the play button in VS Code.

8. Once the application starts running, a Login dialog box will appear.
   - For Username, enter "test".
   - For Password, enter "test".

9. On the top right corner, enter data as per your needs:
   - "Enter data (manually, comma-separated)"
   - "Generate data (Provide a range, data will be automatically generated, say 1000)"
   - "Excel file (you can also use an Excel file to enter data)"

## Notes
- Install Python on your system (required to run the project).
- Install pip on your system (required to install the dependencies used in the project).
